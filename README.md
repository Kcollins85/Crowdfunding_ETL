# Crowdfunding_ETL

For the ETL mini project, I worked with a partner to practise building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transforming the data, I created CSV files that were used to an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
